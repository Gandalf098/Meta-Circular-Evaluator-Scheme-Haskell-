Exploring these topics: 
 Haskell
 Scheme
 Parsers
 Interpreting
 Compiling
 Lambda Calculus
 Typed Lambda Calculus
 Functional Programming
 Pure Functial Programming
 Type-driven Development
 
By building projects and showing how language and different architecture realted decisions affect the project as a whole to show the importance of Software Engineering, Theortical Knowledge and Functional Programming and why these things matter especially for people who know a language or two but never been [or are clumsy at] building big projects

Note: This project focuses on being an intermediate guided intro to more advanced topics, as friendly as possible, and as it becomes more difficult for the authors and the readers alike to introduce very beginner level concepts , less advanced readers are expected to google or do some fast online research when they don't understand a topic

although the series requiers no additional knowledge before starting the topics are diverse and maybe hard to grasp for people who have been ocassionally exposed to programming

Best Wishes !
